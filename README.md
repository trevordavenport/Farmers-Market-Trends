Farmers-Market-Trends
=====================

>  The Department of Agriculture recently released over 8,000 detailed locations of farmers markets in the U.S. With      this data, my goal was to find trends that relate number of farmers markets per state (or county) and the obesity       rates of said locations. This will perhaps give insight to trends in obesity and availability of farmers markets.      Some libraries used include Matplotlib, Folium (mapping coordinates), pandas, numpy, and quite a bit more.
